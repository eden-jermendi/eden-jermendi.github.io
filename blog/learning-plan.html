        <h1 class="gradient-heading">Bootcamp Learning Plan</h1>
        <h3>September 2025</h3>

        <!-- here -->

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
        <p>
          With the skills I gain during this course I plan on working in
          development for the first couple years likely as a Jr Full-stack Dev.
          My impact (or at least my intention) is to work with immigrants,
          refugees, and other minorities to bridge the gap between culture,
          stress/scariness of immigration or seeking refuge, and to find a way
          to help this demographic assimilate better. I want to create more
          support for dealing with racism, and develop online learning apps for
          immigrants covering language and cultural differences. I could go into
          backend or cybersecurity, or stay in full stack or maybe even full
          front-end design. I'm keeping my options open for now.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Strengths & Limitations in Bootcamp</h2>
        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>Pattern recognition and thinking ahead.</li>
          <li>Strong foundation from prior study.</li>
          <li>
            Self-awareness of strengths and weaknesses, and actively working to
            grow alongside them.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>Overthinking and overanalyzing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Biggest Non-Technical Challenge</h2>
        <p>
          I think I will definitely get burnt out near the end, so I'm trying to
          set up a good sleep schedule now and have a plan for if I start to
          overexert myself daily. I may also be too commandeering in a group, so
          I want to allow other people to shine and not control the situation
          too much.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Human Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>Improve my sporadic, sometimes neurotic nature.</li>
          <li>
            Learn not to react heavily when triggered under stressful
            situations.
          </li>
          <li>Strengthen overall conscientiousness and self-discipline.</li>
          <li>
            Teamwork skills: giving and receiving feedback better, and learning
            to implement feedback effectively.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">What I Expect From the Bootcamp Team</h2>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li><strong>Basic respect</strong> (the same I give).</li>
          <li>
            <strong>Patience</strong> if I ramble or need to process things in a
            more neurodivergent way.
          </li>
          <li>
            A <strong>gentle nudge back on track</strong> if I go off course.
          </li>
          <li>
            Honestly, everything I've seen from Dev Academy so far has been
            great, so my expectations are already being met.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">What I Expect From Myself</h2>
        <p>
          Similar to my previous learning plan, I'll ensure I engage more with
          others in my team/cohort and facilitators, even if I just need extra
          support. I've already been doing this more, but keeping it up during
          bootcamp will be vital.
        </p>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>
            I'll manage myself productively and safely with
            <strong>faculty, cohort, and industry/community reps</strong> by
            sticking to my values:
            <ul class="inside-dot">
              <li>Respect</li>
              <li>Willingness to understand</li>
              <li>Being okay with being wrong</li>
              <li>Staying open to learning and constructive feedback</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            As an <strong>immigrant and member of the LGBTQ+ community</strong>,
            I don't take belittlement, discrimination, or harassment lightly.
            I'm comfortable calling it out in the moment (in a healthy way) and
            will escalate to faculty if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            If I feel my
            <strong>emotions or stress are getting too much</strong>, I'll:
            <ul class="inside-dot">
              <li>Step away to calm down.</li>
              <li>Ask to be excused if I'm in a call or presentation.</li>
              <li>Use breathing exercises or jot thoughts down.</li>
              <li>
                Come back when I feel level headed and ready to re-engage.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            If I'm stuck (after trying for 15-20 minutes on my own) or confused
            about course work, I'll <strong>reach out to facilitators</strong>
            and wait patiently for a response.
          </li>
        </ul>

          Foundations Learning Plan
        </h1>
        <h3>September 2025</h3>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Long-Term Goal / Career Pathway</h2>
        <p>
          I'm into <strong>cybersec (pentesting / ethical hacking)</strong>,
          network stuff, and UI/UX frontend stuff and also backend, but I'm not
          locking myself into one path yet. I'll try things, see what I vibe
          with, and choose as I go. If I end up a
          <strong>senior full-stack dev</strong>, I'm sweet with that too - the
          goal is solid skills, decent money, and interesting problems that help
          people (esp. Maori and immigrants/refugees). I'm also keen to dabble
          in <strong>AI/LLMs</strong> for language-learning tools down the line.
        </p>
        <p>Other areas I'd consider:</p>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>Backend engineer - maybe working toward a senior position.</li>
          <li>Consultancy in the future or might move to Australia 2027.</li>
          <li>
            Doing work with Maori and immigrants/refugees for better outcomes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Building language learning apps with AI (I definitely want to work
            with ML + LLMs and that kind of stuff).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Strengths & Limitations in Learning</h2>

        <h3>Strengths</h3>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>
            <strong>Humour, bravery, creativity, love of learning</strong> ->
            aligns with Eagle's boldness, Owl's analysis, and Big Five openness.
            (from prev personality test that I agree with tbh)
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Relational style</strong> -> value intimacy and compassion
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Leadership</strong> -> introverted but assertive, so I'm
            fine in smaller groups but can take charge when needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Driving force</strong> -> strong mix of imagination,
            emotional awareness, and justice-seeking.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Limitations</h3>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>
            <strong>Self-discipline</strong> -> biggest thing I've had to work
            on.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Neurodivergence</strong> -> I've got undiagnosed ADHD and
            autism, which makes focus, stress, and procrastination a bit harder.
            Working toward a diagnosis + treatment in the next few months/early
            next year.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Stress & sensitivity</strong> -> can disrupt productivity,
            but I'm actively learning strategies to manage it.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Human Skills I Want to Develop</h2>
        <ul class="inside-dot">
          <li>
            <strong>Reframing procrastination</strong> -> getting more done
            while being kinder to myself, not shaming myself.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Self-reflection + meta-skills</strong> that make me better
            in every area of life.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Reframing networking</strong> -> instead of scary/ass
            kissing, see it as a skill I already have (just applying it to a new
            industry).
          </li>
          <li>
            Generally want to grow in
            <strong>balance, resilience, and communication</strong>.
          </li>
        </ul>
