          Three New Things I Learned About Myself
        </h2>
        <p>
          I learned that my internal need to be right all the time clouds my
          ability to learn or gain as much from a conversation or a teaching
          moment as my full potential allows. I have also learned that it's okay
          to fail and be down on myself, but it's just as important to practice
          positive self-talk and pick myself back up. Additionally, I have
          learned how to practice self-discipline and motivate myself without
          stress and a deadline being the only motivator.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">
          The Role of Values, Empathy, and Self-Awareness in Learning and
          Programming
        </h2>
        <p>
          One's values, level of empathy, and amount of self-awareness influence
          learning and programming more than most people would assume. If an
          individual is technically skilled but doesn't have enough empathy to
          help a colleague, they're of limited use to a team. Without
          self-awareness, it's difficult to recognize personal flaws and their
          impact on work and teammates. Values determine intent behind
          decisions, whether in code or interpersonally. Often, these traits are
          more important than technical knowledge alone.

          What Surprised Me Most About Human Skills Learning
        </h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I assumed the curriculum would focus mainly on team
          building or interpersonal skills, but the scope is much broader. The
          traits and ideas the curriculum encourages reflection on are also more
          specific than I expected.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">Most Challenging Aspects</h2>
        <p>
          The most challenging part was being vulnerable and posting personal
          reflections on a blog visible to every facilitator and cohort member.
          However, I also recognize the strength that comes from being
          vulnerable, as long as it stays within tolerable discomfort.

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">
          Why Human Skills Are Important in a Programming Bootcamp
        </h2>
        <p>
          These skills aren't just incredibly useful for our future careers in
          tech, making us stronger candidates for management or team lead
          roles.. they also help us grow as individuals. Developing human skills
          alongside technical skills creates a more balanced and effective
          professional.
        </p>

        <h2 class="gradient-heading">
          Was Studying Human Skills a Waste of Time?
        </h2>
        <p>
          I wish there was more time spent on human skills. I'm excited to
          continue developing these skills throughout bootcamp, in my personal
          life, and in my career. I absolutely do not consider this time a
          waste; in fact, most programming schools would benefit from
          integrating human skills training as effectively as this curriculum
          does.
